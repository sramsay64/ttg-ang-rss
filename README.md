TTG-ANG-RSS
===========
The unofficial Tea Tree Gully Anglican RSS podcast feed generator
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a `zsh` script to generate a podcast rss feed for the Tea Tree Gully Anglican church. The churches website has the sermons available but only via a human readable [web page](http://www.teatreegullyanglican.org.au/sermon-listing). The script does some regex on the web page to grab to details and injects them into the template xml files. An automatically updated output of this script is available at <https://rss.houghtondigital.net/ttg-ang.xml>.
